# Real State Application In Java OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

Welcome to the Real Estate Application project! üè°‚ú® This Java-based application leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to provide a robust and scalable solution for managing real estate properties.

Designed with both functionality and user experience in mind, this app is perfect for real estate professionals and enthusiasts who want to manage property listings, search for properties, and perform various real estate-related tasks.

Encapsulation: Ensures data integrity and security through private attributes and public getter/setter methods.

Abstraction: Abstracts complex operations behind user-friendly methods and interfaces.

# Technologies Used:
Java: Core language for application development.

Swing/JavaFX: For creating the graphical user interface.

File I/O or JDBC: For data persistence and storage.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Fundamental design principles applied throughout the project.
